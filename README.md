# StandUp!
#### It's not a joke!

StandUp is a program that helps you take breaks during sessions where you are at your desk.
Health officials suggest both standing up from your desk and looking away from your screen
periodically when you are sitting and working at a computer for extended periods of time.
But when you're in the zone and focusing on work it is easy to forget about that!
This program will make it hard to forget!

Set a length of time that you will be working at your computer.
Set an interval for reminders to pup up during your work session.

You can currently choose between two types of reminders:
  - Open a URL: enter any URL you'd like and the program will open a new tab to that page every interval.
  - Focus on the StandUp app: after every interval the StandUp window will be raised to the front of your desktop and will take focus.

That's it!

Written in Python 3 with PyQt5.
Uses the webbrowser standard library module to open URL's.
